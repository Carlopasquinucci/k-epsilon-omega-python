# k-epsilon-omega-python
Off line calculator of k omega and epsilon

## Content  
In this repository you can find an offline calculator for k omega and epsilon values for turbulent CFD simulations.

In this repository you can find a simple Python code that read

1_ Velocity

2_ Turbulence lengtt scale

3_ Turbulence intensity

from an input data file and write:

1_ Turbulence kinetic energy	(k) [m^2/s^2]

2_ Turbulence dissipation (Îµ) [m^2/s^3]

3_ Specific tubulence dissipation (omega) [1/s]

in an output file.

## Explanation ready - Support
The code is written in a very simple way, in order to be easily understood, but if you need other explanation, feel free to contact me:

## Disclaimer
The code is very simple and the results are compared with other on-line calculator, i.e. https://www.cfd-online.com/Tools/turbulence.php .

The code is tested with Python 2.7.
The code is not robust, since the goal is that this code should be incorporate in other codes.

In any case, no warranty of accuracy, robustness and correctness is given.
